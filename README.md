## Mongo DB setup <a name = "getting_started"></a>

From browser create a account on MongoDB Atlas,
than while creating Cluster add the IP as Access from anywhere i.e 0.0.0.0/0

Create the user
* NOTE : while creating password for the user if using special char like ": / ? # [ ] @"
use the URL encoded format in the connection string 

For example, if your password in plain-text is p@ssw0rd'9'!, 

you need to encode your password as:

p%40ssw0rd%279%27%21

Than click on Database under Deployment from left side nav bar

click on connect --> select drivers --> run npm install mongdodb if u not having it in the package.json

![Alt text](/images/image.png)

Copy the connection string into .ENV file in your connection string remove double quotes
and replace the <password> with your password with url encoding of special char.



run
```
npm  i

npm  start
```
Also to have a view of browser in vscode you can install the MongdoDb extension in vscode

* Note in URL if you just mention
c1ggocx.mongodb.net/dbname

instead of this it will create automatically a db 
c1ggocx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority


### Now Change the dir to Frontend


RUN commands to install packages and start the application
```
npm i
npm start
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.
